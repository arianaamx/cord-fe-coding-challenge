## Last Updated

24-02-2021

### Introduction

Welcome! This coding challenge is designed to show my React & SCSS frontend skills.

### The challenge

You have to complete the test and write any necessary code so that the search page looks like this [mockup]. All the images/icons you need are already imported into this repository.

The discover page should enable the user to search for movies as keywords are typed into the search bar. Functionality for filtering does not need to be implemented, however the filter categories should still be expandable upon clicking. On mobile devices, the navigation bar should slide in from left to right when the user clicks on the hamburger icon.

There will also be some UI bugs that you should spot and fix. In addition, you have to add all the responsive stylesheets for the app to run smoothly on mobile devices.

Movie data can be queried via:

- [theMovieDB]

Packages & Technologies used in the repo:

- `axios`
- `node-sass`
- `react-router-dom`
- `styled-components`
- `react-responsive`
- `react-icons`

### Installation and Setup Instructions
